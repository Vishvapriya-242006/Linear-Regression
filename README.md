#  Linear Regression Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of building and evaluating a **Linear Regression** model using Python's `scikit-learn` library.  
It focuses on the following key steps:
- Importing and preprocessing a dataset
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Fitting a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Plotting the regression line and interpreting model coefficients

The goal is to understand how regression analysis works in practice and how to measure the model's effectiveness.
